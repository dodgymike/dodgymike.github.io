## It begins
I thought I'd start writing up all of the projects I've been busy with over the past year or so, and perhaps a little about what I'd like to do over the next couple of years.

Thanks to [Cobus Barnard](http://cobus.io/) and his suggestion of using [Jekyll on Github](http://cobus.io/ruby/2015/01/26/basic-github-jekyll-blog.html) as a blogging platform. So far it's going well ;)

## Some of the things I've been busy with
* Taking cheap LED strips and making them {explode, flash, melt, flicker and light up}
* Making LED Poi/hula-hoops
* Breaking car alarm systems
* Messing with microphones at the various cons I go to
* Parsing and mangling data-sets from the [Internet-Wide Scan Data Repository](https://scans.io)
* Making electronics badges for [BSidesCapeTown](http://www.bsidescapetown.co.za/)
* Gnuradio modules
